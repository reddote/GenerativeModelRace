# GenerativeModelRace

Welcome to the **GenerativeModelRace** repository! This project is built using Unity 2023.2.6f1 and integrates a generative model via API to transform selected images into 3D `.obj` models. These models can then be utilized in racing games, providing a unique and customizable gaming experience where you can bring your own designs to life on the race tracks.

## Features
- **Image Selection**: Choose an image that you would like to convert into a 3D model.
- **Generative Model API**: Automatically communicates with a generative model to process the image and generate a 3D model in `.obj` format.
- **3D Model Integration**: Import the generated `.obj` file directly into your racing game project in Unity.
- **Custom Model Usage**: Use your unique 3D models as game assets in your racing game.

## Prerequisites
To use GenerativeModelRace, you need to have the following installed:
- **Unity 2023.2.6f1**: The project is developed with this specific version. Please ensure it is installed to avoid compatibility issues.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/GenerativeModelRace.git](https://github.com/reddote/GenerativeModelRace.git)
   cd GenerativeModelRace
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Unity**:
   - Launch Unity Hub.
   - Click on 'Add' and navigate to the cloned project directory.
   - Select the project folder to add it to your Unity Hub.
   - Click on the project in Unity Hub to open it in Unity.

## Usage

2. **Select an Image**: Use the built-in file dialog to choose an image you wish to convert.
3. **Generate the Model**:
   - Click the 'Generate' button to send the image to the generative model API.
   - The API will process the image and return a `.obj` file.
4. **Import and Use Your Model**:
   - Import the `.obj` file into your Unity project.
   - Apply textures and materials as needed.
